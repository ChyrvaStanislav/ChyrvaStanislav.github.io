These types of software are designed to make the process more efficient, so you can focus on your project goals and not waste time on manual tasks. These solutions can be used to improve your development workflow, create and execute test plans, and monitor the performance of your applications.\\n\\n### What is Cloud-based and DevOps software?\\n\\n*   Cloud-based software is any type of software that\'s hosted on a cloud computing platform, which means it can run from anywhere with an internet connection — in other words, from your computer or mobile device. Cloud-based solutions are often preferred over on-premise solutions because they allow accessing data remotely, without having to install software on your own servers. This makes it easier for the employees to collaborate across departments, locations, and time zones.\\n*   DevOps is also a relatively new concept, but it has been around before cloud computing was even invented. The term \\"DevOps\\" refers to the process of developing and deploying new software applications — meaning the two terms are closely linked. \\"DevOps\\" stands for Development Operations which refers to a culture shift within an organization towards collaboration between developers and operations teams so that they can develop better products faster while maintaining high availability and scalability standards across all environments (production, staging, etc.).\\n\\n### Cloud & DevOps software from EPAM\\n\\nCloud and DevOps software is the best way to take your business to the next level.

These types of software are designed to make the process more efficient, so you can focus on your project goals and not waste time on manual tasks. These solutions can be used to improve your development workflow, create and execute test plans, and monitor the performance of your applications.\\n\\n### What is Cloud-based and DevOps software?\\n\\n*   Cloud-based software is any type of software that\'s hosted on a cloud computing platform, which means it can run from anywhere with an internet connection — in other words, from your computer or mobile device. Cloud-based solutions are often preferred over on-premise solutions because they allow accessing data remotely, without having to install software on your own servers. This makes it easier for the employees to collaborate across departments, locations, and time zones.\\n*   DevOps is also a relatively new concept, but it has been around before cloud computing was even invented. The term \\"DevOps\\" refers to the process of developing and deploying new software applications — meaning the two terms are closely linked. \\"DevOps\\" stands for Development Operations which refers to a culture shift within an organization towards collaboration between developers and operations teams so that they can develop better products faster while maintaining high availability and scalability standards across all environments (production, staging, etc.).\\n\\n### Cloud & DevOps software from EPAM\\n\\nCloud and DevOps software is the best way to take your business to the next level. Our team at EPAM has developed a variety of cloud-based solutions to help businesses succeed in every area, from development and testing to security and resource management.\\n\\nWhether your company is just starting out or just looking for a new way to improve its current processes, EPAM will work with you every step of the way so that together we can find the solution that works best for your needs.","title":"Best Cloud-based & DevOps software solutions"},"meta":{"description":"Best Cloud based & DevOps software solutions developed by EPAM.

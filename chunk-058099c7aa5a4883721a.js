In this article, we\'ll break down the business rules engine and explain how it works.**\\n\\nA business rules engine is becoming more popular as organizations look for ways to automate manual processes, thus saving time and money. This is especially important in light of the growing demand for automation in the digital economy. Businesses need a tool that can make decisions based on data from multiple sources.\\n\\nMost business rules engines are used in a variety of industries, such as insurance, supply chain management, human resources, logistics, marketing, and sales, and have a broad range of applications. They are frequently used in financial institutions to aid in the automation of compliance procedures and risk management. They are also used in retail, where they aid in inventory management and pricing optimization.\\n\\n## Business Rules Engine Definition\\n\\nSo, what is business rules engine software? A business rules engine (BRE) is an application that enables you to automate business operations and the execution of business logic. It is used to fulfill a set of rules to reduce manual data entry and automate repetitive tasks such as reporting and eligibility requirements. Companies can use a BRE for decision-making, to cut costs, improve efficiency, reduce errors, and accelerate time-to-market.\\n\\nThe business rules engine lets you define what should happen in response to certain events or actions and automate decisions based on predefined and preloaded conditions. They are especially useful when there are many possible outcomes based on different conditions and criteria. For example, if a customer places an order for a product, you can define a set of business rules that determines how quickly it should be shipped and whether it should be delivered by mail or by truck.\\n\\n## What is the Purpose of a Business Rule Engine\\n\\nThe purpose of a BRE is to make sure that the decision-making process is consistent and follows company policy. Business rules engines can help improve decision-making processes by creating automated responses to situations that occur in real-time. The goal is to reduce human intervention in order to increase efficiency and accuracy as well as provide consistency across departments or locations.","adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false}},{"text":"#### **Business Rules Engines are used for:**\\n\\n* Creating and maintaining software applications like CRM and ERP apps\\n\\n* Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements like SOX, PCI, ISO 27001 etc.\\n\\n* Managing exceptions and errors in your application\\n\\n* Improving customer experience by providing them with consistent responses even if they enter incorrect data\\n\\n* Managing user permissions on websites and apps\\n\\n* Conducting compliance checks on sensitive data like credit card information\\n\\n* Ensuring that orders are processed correctly by your warehouse management system (WMS)\\n\\n> **Example of Business Rules Engine**\\n>\\n> Open source [Rule Engine](https://solutionshub.epam.com/solution/rule-engine) from EPAM allows you to create and manage business rules in Salesforce quickly on your own, without involving the IT department to write code.

It can help your business run more proficiently and accurately, while also helping you stay in compliance with regulations.\\n\\nHere are some of the main advantages of using a business rules engine:\\n\\n### 1. High efficiency\\n\\nThe most benefit of using business rule engines is that they help make processes more efficient. The software automates repetitive tasks that may need human attention, so employees don’t have to do them manually anymore. This frees up their time from making a lot of manual decisions for other tasks that need to be done instead of spending all day doing the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n### 2. Improved precision\\n\\nThe software system ensures that everything is done correctly by verifying that all inputs are valid before performing any actions on them. Thus nothing gets lost or overlooked during the process, which can result in errors or mistakes being made later on down the line when you least expect it.\\n\\n### 3. Increased Compliance and Auditing\\n\\nBusiness rules engines help companies to stay in compliance with regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). They also help companies to audit their own data and understand if they\'re meeting compliance requirements. This way BRE ensures process owners know and follow the rules. The rules engine may not just monitor what people do, it can also monitor who does what, when, and how often they do it. If there is any deviation from the norm, this will be flagged for review immediately. The system will also allow you to see the history of compliance violations so that you can track trends over time and identify potential trouble spots before they occur.\\n\\n### 4. Better Flexibility\\n\\nThe ability to make changes to the application without having to re-write code is extremely valuable. With an automated business rules engine, you can change the existing code without having to worry about breaking something else in the application. This also means that if someone else on your team makes a change, it won\'t affect other parts of your application that may not be affected by this change. It also helps ensure that any new features don\'t break existing ones as well.\\n\\n### 5. Higher Productivity\\n\\nBusiness rules engines allow IT professionals, and developers, to work together more efficiently by eliminating the need for rework due to errors during translation from English-like natural language rules into executable code. This means less downtime, fewer maintenance costs, and greater productivity for both IT staff and end users who need access to these rules while they are working on other projects within their respective workgroups.\\n\\n### 6. Better Business Agility\\n\\nBREs can enable businesses to make changes faster than before, allowing them to react more quickly and efficiently to opportunities as they arise. This enhances their agility and ability to compete effectively with other businesses in their industry. A well-designed business rule engine can improve decision-making and achieving business goals by providing context-sensitive information about how business decisions should be made based on current conditions and past outcomes.\\n\\n### 7. Increased Decision Quality\\n\\nBREs allow businesses to improve their decision quality by providing consistent results for each decision made across multiple systems within an organization or across different departments within each company. Informed decisions are made thanks to simple rules set in advance. Financial institutions, for example, can benefit from BRE when deciding whether to grant a loan or not. \\n\\n### 8. Reduced costs\\n\\nAutomating business rules helps reduce costs by reducing manual labor and enabling faster processing times. For example, in healthcare, it can increase productivity by automating manual processes that require multiple steps to complete one activity such as reporting patient data or creating prescriptions.","adverisingBlock":{"imageForDesktop":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"8c15b73c-cb73-4c29-bf71-baa7e5a384f1","name":"iSwarm_1334-1024","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"imageForTablet":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"653438c7-ca56-4437-8f07-fe86a736e30c","name":"iSwarm_768-568","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"imageForMobile":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"3c0c9df8-b72d-4936-86b4-f1f894f5b717","name":"iSwarm_567-320","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"enableDarkMode":false,"solutionName":"iSwarm","solutionDescription":"Sentiment analysis software","link":"https://solutionshub.epam.com/solution/iswarm"}},{"text":"## How Business Rules Engines Work\\n\\nAs we have already learned, a business rules engine is a software framework that automates business processes by implementing a set of pre-defined rules. These rules are based on criteria such as goals, company policies, and other parameters defined by a user. Depending on the type of BRE, it’s necessary to create decision tables, decision trees, pseudo-natural language, or programming-like code to set these rules. The engine uses these parameters to evaluate data from various sources and determine if an action needs to be taken based on the results of this evaluation.\\n\\n#### Inputs and outputs for business rules engine\\n\\nBusiness rules engine takes data as input and produces an output based on the business rules. In order to do this, it needs to parse the input data into a format that can be processed by the engine, execute the rules against this data, merge the results back into the output form that is expected by the user interface (UI) application, and finally display it in an understandable way. Business rules engines can receive inputs from multiple sources such as databases or spreadsheets. They also provide outputs such as notifications or alerts when certain conditions are met within your organization’s workflow process.\\n\\n## Types of Business Rules Engine\\n\\nThere are several types of business rules engines:\\n\\n### 1. Script-based rule engine\\n\\nThis type uses a programming language to define the rules. The programmer writes the code and tests it before deploying it in production. Script-based engines are good for simple logic, but if you have complex logic, then this type of engine will not be suitable for you.\\n\\n### 2. Declarative rule engine\\n\\nThe declarative rule engine is a more sophisticated type of business engine that can be used in an enterprise setting. It enables more complex workflows, decision logic-based BRE, and calculations to run in the background without the need for user input or involvement.\\n\\n### 3. Hybrid rule engine\\n\\nIt combines the best features of both script-based and declarative engines. Hybrid rule engine has a graphical interface for ease of use, but it also supports programmatic development or coding-based bre.\\n\\n### 4. Rule-based rule engines\\n\\nThis type of engine is very easy to use and can be used by non-technical people as well. The only drawback with this kind of engine is that it\'s not scalable and cannot handle complex logic easily.\\n\\n### 5. Coding-based rule engine\\n\\nThis type of rules engine is good for complex logic, but it\'s difficult to write and maintain code because you need programming skills to create the rules using this kind of system.\\n\\n## Conclusion: How to Choose the Best Business Rules Engine\\n\\nThe best BRE for your company will be determined by your specific needs and requirements. However, there are some general guidelines you can follow to help you select the best engine for your company:\\n\\n* Check that it is simple to use and understand and that your employees would be able to customize it as needed\\n\\n* Check that the engine is scalable and capable of handling the growth of your organization\\n\\n* Make sure it is adaptable and can be tailored to your organization\'s specific requirements\\n\\n* Check that the engine is dependable and has a good reputation.\\n\\nIf you can identify areas of requirement and user demands, a business rules system can be extremely beneficial to your company. You can select the best type of BRE for your business based on the scope of tasks and level of complexity, and improve the efficiency of teams such as HR, office administration, finance, sales, purchasing, and so on. Process automation tools without code are a great way to set up a process without knowing how to code.","adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false}}],"recommendedPostsReferences":[{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"a474a9fc-59d9-4c7a-abb5-b67b02997575"},{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"aeeba602-85e9-4233-bee2-05fb8035184e"},{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"7b6f2e82-5128-4e42-b248-94b12edef474"},{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"c97fc922-c905-475a-9da3-f24dbe45454b"}],"meta":{"title":"What is Business Rules Engine: Types and Benefits | EPAM SolutionsHub","description":"Business rules engine is a powerful tool to improve business processes and save time and money.

There are several reasons for on-premise to cloud migration: the agility and flexibility that the cloud provides, the scalability of its resources, and the cost-effectiveness of its pay-as-you-go model.\\n\\nHowever, migrating to the cloud can also pose some risks. In order to migrate from on-premises to cloud safely and effectively, businesses need to have a clear strategy in place. They also need to choose the right process and tools for their specific needs.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we\'ll cover all of these aspects of on-premise to cloud migration. We\'ll discuss how to develop a sound strategy, what steps should be taken during the migration process.\\n\\n## Why do businesses migrate from on premise to cloud?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why businesses might want to migrate from on-premise software to the cloud. The cloud offers reduced costs, improved efficiency, scalability, and more. For businesses that are still running on-premise software, migrating to the cloud can offer a number of benefits.","adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false}},{"text":"Some businesses might be reluctant to migrate to the cloud services and applications because they are concerned about the security of their data. However, if done correctly, migrating to the cloud can actually improve your security posture. In fact, many of the world\'s largest companies have already made the switch to the cloud.\\n\\nIf you\'re considering migrating to the cloud, there are a few things you should keep in mind:\\n\\n1. **The risks of migration.** There are a few risks associated with migrating to the cloud. These include data loss, security breaches, and downtime. However, these risks can be mitigated with proper planning and execution.\\n\\n2. **The costs of migration.** Migrating to the cloud can be costly. You will need to factor in the cost of new hardware, software, and services. You will also need take into account the cost of training your staff on how to use the new system.\\n\\n3. **The process of migration.** In order to migrate to the cloud successfully, you will need to have a clear plan in place. You will need to choose the right tools and services\\n\\nWith these things in mind, let\'s take a look at three methods for migrating to the cloud without fully transitioning your operations.\\n\\n## **Cloud migration strategies**\\n\\nOrganizations looking to migrate to the cloud have a number of options available to them. Among different migration strategies there are five most popular cloud migration techniques: rehosting, replatforming, refactoring, repurchasing, and retiring.\\n\\n### **1. Rehosting**\\n\\nThis is the most common type of cloud migration. It involves moving an application or workload to a cloud platform with little or no modification. This is often the quickest and easiest way to migrate an application to the cloud. However, it can also be the most expensive option, as you will need to purchase new hardware and software.\\n\\n### 2. Replatforming\\n\\nThis type of migration involves making some changes to an application or workload in order to optimize it for the cloud platform. This can include changes such as redesigning the architecture, rewriting code, or changing the database.\\n\\n### 3. Refactoring (or Re-architecting)\\n\\nThis is a more extreme form of replatforming that involves significant changes to an application or workload. This type of migration is usually done when replatforming is not an option. It involves making significant changes to an application or workload in order to make it compatible with the cloud platform.\\n\\n### 4. Repurchasing (or Replacing)\\n\\nReplacing an on-premise application with a cloud-based solution is a repurchasing strategy that can be done when migrating to the cloud. This process can be greatly aided if the vendor of the new SaaS product offers data migration capabilities and tools, which might not be the case when changing to a different software provider. An assessment of the expected migration effort should be conducted before beginning this type of project.\\n\\n### 5. Retiring\\n\\nRetiring an application or workload means ceasing to use it and decommissioning it. This is often done when an application has reached the end of its life cycle or is no longer needed. It can also be done as part of a cloud migration strategy in order to simplify the process.\\n\\nNow that we\'ve covered the five most popular cloud migration techniques, let\'s take a look at three steps you should take when migrating to the cloud.\\n\\n## **Three steps to a successful on-premise to cloud migration**\\n\\nThere are three main steps to a successful cloud migration:\\n\\n### **1. Planning and Preparation**\\n\\nThe first step to any successful migration is planning and preparation. You need to assess your current workloads and determine which ones can be migrated to the cloud. You also need to create a budget and timeline for the project.","adverisingBlock":{"imageForDesktop":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"d8c9fc61-6c27-4302-9011-60568b9822ed","name":"MigVisor1334-1024","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"imageForTablet":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"a071b5ed-6f04-4a36-89ee-705d1aa6db99","name":"MigVisor768-568","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"imageForMobile":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"0fb21381-0d5c-40c6-929e-1c16213b718b","name":"MigVisor567-320","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"enableDarkMode":false,"solutionName":"migVisor by EPAM","solutionDescription":"Database migration assessment tool","link":"https://solutionshub.epam.com/solution/migvisor-by-epam"}},{"text":"### **2. Migration**\\n\\nOnce you\'ve planned and prepared for the migration, it\'s time to actually migrate your data and applications to the cloud. This is where working with a cloud migration service can be helpful. They can handle the heavy lifting for you and help ensure that everything is migrated correctly.\\n\\n### **3. Post-migration**\\n\\nOnce the migration is complete, it\'s important to monitor your workloads in the cloud and make sure everything is running smoothly. You may need to make some adjustments along the way, but post-migration monitoring will help ensure that your transition to the cloud is successful.\\n\\n## **What are common cloud migration challenges?**\\n\\nCloud migration can be complex, costly, and risky. There are a number of potential challenges that can arise during a cloud migration project. These include complexity, cost, security, compatibility, and downtime. By carefully planning your migration and choosing the right tools and services, you can help mitigate these risks. However, if you do not plan carefully or if you try to migrate too quickly, you may run into problems.\\n\\n### **1. Complexity**\\n\\nMigrating to the cloud can be complex, especially if you have a large and diverse workload. You need to assess your workloads and determine which ones can be migrated easily and which ones will be more difficult.\\n\\n### **2. Cost**\\n\\nMigrating to the cloud can be costly, especially if you have a lot of data and applications to migrate. You need to create a budget for the project and make sure that you have the resources available to complete it.\\n\\n### **3. Security**\\n\\nOne of the risks that businesses face when migrating to the cloud is security. When you move your data off-premise, you are entrusting it to a third party. This means that you need to do your due diligence to ensure that your chosen provider has robust security measures in place to protect your data. One way to do this is to look for a cloud provider that is ISO 27001 certified. This certification means that the provider has been independently verified to have in place the controls required to maintain the security of your data. Another way to help ensure the security of your data is to encrypt it before it is sent off-premise. This will help to protect your data in transit and at rest.\\n\\n### **4. Compatibility**\\n\\nNot all applications and workloads are compatible with the cloud, which can make migration more difficult. There are several ways how to cope with risk of non-compatibility. The first is - to choose a cloud migration strategy that is compatible with your workloads. For example, you can use a \\"lift and shift\\" strategy for applications that are not compatible with the cloud. This involves moving existing on-premise applications and infrastructure to the cloud with minimal changes.\\n\\nAnother way to avoid compatibility issues is to use a \\"replatforming\\" strategy, which involves making some changes to an application or piece of infrastructure before moving it to the cloud. This can help make sure that your workloads are compatible with the cloud before they are migrated. Finally, you can use a \\"cloud-native\\" strategy, which involves designing applications specifically for you.\\n\\n### **5.Downtime**\\n\\nOne of the risks of cloud migration is downtime. It can occur when data or applications are being migrated to the cloud, which can disrupt business operations. To avoid this, businesses need to plan their migration carefully and choose the right tools and services to help minimize downtime.\\n\\nOne way to avoid the risk of downtime during cloud migration is to use a tool that allows you to replicate your on-premises data and applications in real-time so that you can quickly switch over if there is any downtime during the migration process. Another way to avoid downtime is to migrate your data and applications during off-peak hours. This will help minimize the impact on your business operations.","image":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"eb3669e5-5218-4d68-b2e9-eef704f8edd0","name":"Migrate-to-the-Cloud","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false},"imageAlt":"on-prem to cloud migration","imageTitle":"on-prem to cloud migration"},{"text":"## **The importance of testing and monitoring in a cloud migration**\\n\\nTesting and quality assurance are critical in any migration, but they are especially important when migrating to the cloud.

Many of them still keep paper records and diaries, as well as outdated software that can be as long as a decade.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a positive trend for clinical trial companies to incorporate software into their workflows. A recent study found that 64% of researchers have used digital health tools in their clinical trials, and 97% plan to use them within the next five years.\\n\\nBefore Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) entered the market, industry players were faced with different types of solutions to replace the functionality of this software. After starting to use the new solution, people noticed that it helped eliminate inconsistencies in the information. This approach greatly improves the accuracy of data used in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need for an integrated system that can simplify workflow and provide ease of use.\\n\\nThe adopted technology for automating clinical trials is called eClinical. Just as healthcare providers have their EHR software, life sciences researchers have e-clinics. These include a platform using electronic data collection (EDC), an interactive voice response system, randomization, and test delivery systems that eliminate the need to enter duplicate data in both solutions. It is worth noting that clinical trial automation is not a panacea that can solve all problems, but a business tool that analyzes performance metrics and helps improve it. Don\'t forget that CTMS also has its downsides, which we\'ll touch as well.\\n\\n## What is a clinical research management system?\\n\\nA Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is a software system used to manage clinical trials in healthcare facilities. CTMS serves as the company\'s single, centralized network resource to support multi-site clinical trials.\\n\\nIn other words, CTMS is a project management tool through which physicians can set milestones and track progress, view performance of each team, plan subject access, manage relationships between different team members, control costs, and of course create reports.\\n\\nCTMS seems to solve integration and consistency issues, as many modern solutions come with EDC support. In addition to Oracle, Bioclinica, and Medidata, popular systems include Parexel MyTrials, Forte OnCore, and more. But many systems in this field are outdated. With the benefits that IT technology brings to clinical trials, CTMS should be available to every pharmaceutical and biotechnology laboratory. If your healthcare facility is looking to replace an existing system or develop a custom system, we want to give you some ideas on what features might be useful and what to look for when choosing software.\\n\\nThis article takes a closer look at the best EPAM clinical trial management software currently available on the market. We also highlight its features and capabilities, as well as challenges that may be encountered when implementing ready-made solutions and why custom ones may be more beneficial for you.\\n\\n## Features To Look for in Clinical Trial Management Software\\n\\nIf you\'re looking for the perfect CTMS, we have a few things to keep in mind. As I said, the demand for these systems is relatively high right now, so more and more similar solutions are entering the market. Based on our experience developing medical solutions, we wanted to talk about the key capabilities that could be included in a software for clinical trial management, and how they could provide a much-needed boost to clinical trials.\\n\\n### Investigator Profile\\n\\nThe profile needs to be embedded in the CTMS, and it usually contains some of the following information about the provider (name, address, license, degree, therapeutic area, and specialty). Currently, investigator profiles on these platforms focus on recruitment and compliance tracking.\\n\\n### Integrate with website\\n\\nThe CTMS needs to make all aspects of the study visible through the website so that users can easily monitor the research process. They help plan website visits by allowing users to view conversation history. These messages include surveillance and security letters, technical issues, introductory documents and payment requests. A CTMS portal that stores documents and manages service levels using workflows should also be integrated.\\n\\n### Solution optimization for mobile devices\\n\\nWe know that most clinical research professionals travel a lot, so being able to work from the comfort of a mobile device is critical. Many prefer cloud-hosted web applications with the convenience that these medical experts can always stay connected and access data from anywhere in the country or the world.\\n\\n### Acceptance of payments or donates\\n\\nCTMS must enable prompt and accurate payments and efficiently handle contract terms to preserve the efficacy of research locations.\\n\\n### Implementation in the cloud\\n\\nEarly CTMS platforms had minimal to no scalability because they were locally deployed and used object-oriented programming. Today\'s cloud systems offer many other practical capabilities in addition to scaling. They can be swiftly deployed and used by partners and personnel both inside and outside the company with a variety of tools. This makes it possible for users to employ such devices in an unprecedented number of clinical settings and applications.\\n\\n### Resource administration\\n\\nIt is crucial to assign people to clinical trials based on their knowledge, availability, abilities, geography, and experience. They are essential to achieving national and research-level objectives.","adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false}},{"image":{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/image-link"},"id":"80d25c9f-1c80-4640-9638-b9830507ef24","name":"Cloud_Pipeline_Logo","endpoint":"epammarketplace","defaultHost":"cdn.media.amplience.net"},"text":"## Clinical Trials Management Solution Examples\\n\\nWork processes and flows also become increasingly complex, busy, and in need of reform or redesign as a result of increased demand for items provided by the life sciences and burgeoning drug development pipelines. CTMS is ideally suited for this situation. Software engineers are constantly looking for ways to increase the capabilities of a single solution.\\n\\nThese days, a wide variety of such tools are available to buy. But we choose the most well-liked ready-made solution to save you time. We\'re hoping this will assist you realize which features are more significant to you and what you want your custom development to include, as well as clear up potential misunderstandings.\\n\\n[EPAM Cloud Pipeline](https://solutionshub.epam.com/solution/cloud-pipeline) is the clinical trial data management software. Usage of a cloud-based environment provides the ability to build and run the customized scripts and workflows that support genomics analysis, modeling and simulation, and machine learning activities that are required to accelerate patient treatment and drug discovery research.\\n\\nThe system combines storage and cloud computing resources into a single service, offering a simple and scalable method to carry out a variety of scientific operations. The primary attributes are:\\n\\n* **Data processing:** Create data processing pipelines (workflow scripts) and run them in the cloud;\\n\\n* **Data storage management:** Store and manage files;\\n\\n* **Tools management:** Create and deploy shared and personal computation environments using Docker’s container concept;\\n\\n* **Scientific computing GUI applications:** launch and run GUI-based applications using a self-service web interface.","adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false}},{"text":"## Analysis of completed CTMS applications\\n\\nIf you begin searching for a CTMS solution on the internet, you will undoubtedly find dozens of ready-made apps designed for clinical trials that have a lot of the same features. It is uncertain that they are adequate to cover all essential clinical trials tasks and provide excellent oversight and control of those activities, despite their appealing interfaces and simple-to-use technologies. As a consequence of our investigation into the evaluations of well-known CTMS applications like Castor, MainEDC, Research Manager, and OpenClinica, we have compiled a list of the glaring flaws that almost all third-party CTMS vendor solutions have:\\n\\n* **Limited functionality** is the most frequent drawback of ready-made solutions because the capabilities they provide do not always address all needs and procedures inside a particular firm;\\n\\n* **A limitation on the number of users/participants** permitted/accepted, which limits how much the solution can be scaled;\\n\\n* **A few medical facilities** can be added to the system for exchanging data on clinical trials;\\n\\n* **The loss of important documentation and the outcomes** of earlier clinical studies is inevitable due to a lack of storage and space;\\n\\n* **Lack of automation and the requirement** for manual labor in many situations.\\n\\n## Clinical Trial Management Challenges\\n\\nHave you observed that each test phase has a number of persistent issues? We can link them to three important problem topics.\\n\\n**Drug development and research might take many years.** The major issue, though, isn\'t even that; rather, it\'s that it gets more expensive, difficult, and demanding every year. The rate at which data is produced is increasing so quickly that managing it is becoming nearly impossible. The ideal solution isn\'t to use more software to process the data. Why? Continue reading to learn why.\\n\\n**Lack of unity.** According to current circumstances, research specialists must operate with a dozen separate systems at once, while clinical trials often use four different data sources. Data originates from a variety of sources, including ePRO surveys, specialized applications, wearable technology, electronic informed consent forms, etc. Even though it\'s not impossible, it will take a lot of time and effort to analyze all of this data.\\n\\nClinical research document sequencing standards and data interchange standardization have recently been introduced.\\n\\n**Integration.** Using some technologies, you can prevent document errors and prevent duplicate sensitive data from being accessed. Because specialists get varied degrees of technology training, this procedure cannot be totally automated due to the range of tools available.\\n\\n## Problem-solving solutions for clinical trials\\n\\nAny change can be challenging, and it frequently is, particularly in a strictly regulated industry like clinical research. We can discuss and attempt to create some all-encompassing software, but will research organizations and sponsors use it? Most likely not. However, there is a solution:\\n\\n### CDISC Clinical Data Standards adoption\\n\\nAn organization that develops standards to assist data interchange in clinical research is called the Clinical Data Exchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Their criteria are applicable to all sorts of study, universal, free, and simply adjustable.\\n\\nCDISC stands for restoring clinical documentation\'s lack of standardization and promoting system integration. Although using CDISC standards is optional, regulatory agencies like the FDA strongly recommend it (United States Food and Drug Administration).\\n\\n### Automating Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Data Capture (EDC) Connectivity Using the OneSource Model\\n\\nThe way data is handled in clinical trials and in the healthcare industry differs significantly. Almost all information is stored digitally and is difficult for all parties to access.\\n\\nThe FDA and the University of California have joined forces to create a technique to automate data transfer from electronic records to EDC in an effort to solve this problem. Its name is OneSource, and it acts as a single repository for data from the ePRO, EHR, and EDC systems. This system gathers and presents data in accordance with CDISC, HL7, and FHIR, three clinical data standards.\\n\\nThe open-source development framework, OneSource, has already been employed by OpenClinica EDC. Any organization that has access to technical resources and a highly competent workforce is said to be able to harmonize to the same degree.\\n\\n### Modernization of legacy CTMS software\\n\\nMany of these systems have not been upgraded since they were first introduced 20 years ago. The software frequently resides locally on a server, making it difficult for modern clinical research techniques to be supported. **We can see two solutions to this issue**.\\n\\n***#1 Change your workflow completely by switching to a new CTMS program.***\\n\\n***#2 Upgrade your outdated software without worrying that it would significantly alter how your staff go about their daily lives.***\\n\\nThe first strategy, though it may appear fairly radical and complex, is a strong long-term bet because the old software will only need more ongoing upkeep and sunk expenses as time goes on.\\n\\nAlso, keep in mind that custom software allows you to make personal changes/adjustments at any time, which is not always the case with ready-made solutions. As a result, redoing the entire solution is frequently the best option.\\n\\nIt would be beneficial if you did not put off making changes indefinitely, because developing an effective digital solution is an investment in your potential, and the sooner you get to it, the sooner you can reap the rich benefits that come with developing such a solution.\\n\\n## Why do we require CTMS?\\n\\nCTMS implementation enables clinical research organizations to increase efficiency and achieve excellent results. CTMS enables you to:\\n\\n* ***In clinical trials, improve the quality of patient care;***\\n\\n* ***Enhance research reports;***\\n\\n* ***Facilitate adherence to research billing regulations;***\\n\\n* ***Improve the management of research finances;***\\n\\n* ***Aids in adhering to research execution procedures and meeting deadlines and timelines.***\\n\\nWe would like to emphasize and reiterate that CTMS is a critical tool for optimizing the clinical research process. Its value is critical not only for assisting businesses, but also for remaining in compliance with the government.\\n\\nThere is no longer a need to use multiple disparate document management systems and tools for research subject management, research compliance, reporting, research data collection, sponsor billing, research billing, and research administration. These legacy systems are extremely time-consuming to maintain and necessitate manual checks to ensure that documents are properly tracked and updated. Furthermore, reporting necessitates significant data reconciliation efforts.\\n\\nMany aspects of research operations are implemented and managed by research teams and underlying researchers. As a result, the ability to effectively manage clinical trials is directly dependent on unit funding, resource availability, and management. The use of CTMS will simplify many aspects of the clinical research process, allowing for faster and better results.","adverisingBlock":{"enableDarkMode":false}}],"recommendedPostsReferences":[{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"12a8b04f-0031-46f6-9434-252d76de4797"},{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"5e6f99c8-6c0e-4989-86f2-61a5505abd74"},{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/solution","id":"49533346-f91b-49ab-bfe9-92b6bd797e42"},{"_meta":{"schema":"http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content-reference"},"contentType":"http://epam.com/blogpost","id":"dcc19efe-7eba-4d98-9f7e-d48eacd5c39a"}],"meta":{"title":"Clinical
